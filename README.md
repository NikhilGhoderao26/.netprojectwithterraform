Here is a sample README.md for your .NET project that explains how to build, test, and deploy with GitHub Actions and Azure App Service:

text
# HelloWorldApp (.NET)

## Project Overview

This is a minimal ASP.NET Core web application that returns "Hello, World!" for the root HTTP request. It includes a test project with xUnit for unit testing.

---

## Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK installed ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download))
- Git
- Azure subscription with permissions to create resources
- Azure CLI installed and logged in (`az login`)
- GitHub account for pushing code and using GitHub Actions CI/CD

---

## How to Build and Test Locally

1. Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd HelloWorldApp

text

2. Restore dependencies:

dotnet restore

text

3. Build the app:

dotnet build

text

4. Run tests:

dotnet test

text

5. Run the app locally:

dotnet run --project HelloWorldApp

text

Visit `http://localhost:5000` to see the greeting.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

- On push to `main` branch, GitHub Actions will:
- Restore dependencies
- Build the solution
- Run tests
- Publish the app
- Deploy it to an Azure App Service configured via Terraform

- **Setup required:**
- Create an Azure App Service and obtain its publish profile
- Add the publish profile as a secret `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE` on GitHub repository settings

---

## Terraform Infrastructure

The infrastructure to host the app is provisioned using Terraform in the `infra` folder. It includes:
- Azure Resource Group
- Azure App Service Plan
- Azure App Service configured for .NET 8

Run the following to deploy the infrastructure:

cd infra
terraform init
terraform apply

text

---

## Assumptions

- Azure CLI is used for authentication during Terraform deploy
- Azure subscription and permissions are valid and accessible
- Default resource names and regions are used for simplicity
- Works for demo or development purposes

---

## Production Improvements

- Use remote Terraform state backend (Azure Storage)
- Use Service Principal authentication for CI/CD automation
- Add automated testing and integration tests
- Configure monitoring and alerting (e.g. Azure Monitor)
- Use higher SKU and configure autoscaling in App Service Plan
- Modularize Terraform code by environment (dev/stage/prod)
- Secure secrets with Vault or Azure Key Vault
